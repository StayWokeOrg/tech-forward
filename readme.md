# Tech Forward

## How to add your organization

All of the organizations are present in `public/js/orgs.json`; just add yours and [make a Pull Request](https://mattstauffer.co/blog/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-github-project-using-your-own-fork).

## To-do

* [x] Add optional address/city/state to each organization
* [ ] Add some content or qualifiers for who should be in here
* [ ] Add installation/serving instructions
* [ ] Make an about note so people aren't as skeptical
* [ ] Handle multi-location (e.g. Tech Solidarity)
