We'll operate on the assumption that Trump means what he says, and that he will work to implement the policies he campaigned on, including mass deportations, \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and visitors, and a registry of Muslim Americans. Together we hope we can find ways to minimize the impact of these policies, help people defend their rights (and fight back), and lobby the companies we work to stop collecting and storing sensitive data wherever possible.",
